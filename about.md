# About Me

Hello! I'm **Daphne Ticola, M.Ed.**, an instructional systems designer with a background in education and a focus on designing meaningful, learner-centered instructional experiences.

I hold a **Master of Education (M.Ed.) in Secondary Education** and am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Instructional Technology and Design (MSITD)** at the **University of North Alabama (UNA)**. Through my graduate studies, I am deepening my expertise in instructional design theory, instructional media, and technology-enhanced learning environments.

This portfolio serves as both an academic and professional space to showcase selected coursework, design artifacts, and reflections that demonstrate my ability to analyze learning needs, apply research-based theory, and design instruction aligned to real-world learning contexts.

### Professional Focus

My interests and experience center on:
- Instructional systems design and analysis  
- Learning theory application (behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism)  
- Learner-centered and performance-focused design  
- Online, blended, and technology-supported learning  
- Reflective practice and continuous improvement  

I am particularly interested in bridging **educational theory and practical instructional design**, ensuring learning solutions are both grounded in research and effective in practice.

### Professional Engagement

I regularly share insights and reflections related to instructional design, learning theory, and professional growth within the field. I welcome professional connections and conversations around learning design and educational technology.
